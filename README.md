## Elise Aston

Language student turned junior full-stack software engineer (proof that I can talk to both humans and computers). Recent graduate from one of the most discerning coding bootcamps, with 6 years' experience of data, marketing, and digital communication in the charity sector. I'm looking to join a team I can contribute to and learn from, in an organisation that I'm proud to be part of.

## Skills

#### Data handling and analysis

With no previous experience in databases, I joined St Luke's Hospice as the sole (and somewhat daunted) Database Administrator, and quickly became adept (often self-taught) in using Blackbaud's SQL-based database Raiser's Edge. A year later I joined the database team at CARE International UK where, due to a long period of understaffing, I was often solely responsible for inputting, importing and running queries and reports on significantly larger quantities of data. Even on changing teams at CARE, I still regularly produced complex reports and analysis. I built tools to optimise this data management, which I taught my colleagues. 

#### Excellent communicator

I have a wide range of both verbal and written communication skills, and enjoy connecting with people. From delivering presentations about microfinance in the developing world to Rotary Clubs and university students, to teaching English to reluctant children in Spain and over-enthusiastic adults in Japan, I am well-experienced in explaining complex concepts to non-expert audiences. As part of the innovative project Lendwithcare.org, I know how to understand and communicate the client's perspective to a developer. In my roles at CARE International and St. Luke's Hospice, I was responsible for composing and sending digital and written communications to the charities' supporters with updates of their work and to thank them for their donations.

#### Project management

Some of my favourite projects that I have managed include setting up and remotely managing a national network of nearly 50 volunteers at Lendwithcare, and facilitating them to promote and explain the charity's work in their local communities. This led to an increase in supporters for the charity, and increased engagement among the volunteers. In November 2018 I led a film crew to Zambia to direct a fundraising video to promote the charity's work (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HeWSX-K-Uk. And as Donor Development Officer at St. Luke's Hospice I created a donation page that enabled supporters to set up a regular direct debit donation online.
