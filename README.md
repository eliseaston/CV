## Elise Aston

I like to move fast, deliver value, occasionally break things, learn from those mistakes, and build again better. I am looking for a team I can contribute to and learn from, at an organisation that I'm proud to be a part of. Full-stack Ruby on Rails developer, but would welcome the opportunity to expand my skills. I bring excellent communication and thoughtful, constructive feedback. I am driven by delivering customer value and believe in regularly shipping well-tested solutions.
