## Elise Aston

Linguist turned junior full-stack software engineer (proof that I can talk to both humans and computers). Recent graduate from one of the top coding bootcamps. I am passionate about creating elegant and test-driven code in an agile manner. I bring a diverse combination of skills from 6 years' experience of data, marketing, and digital communication in the charity sector. I'm looking to join a team I can contribute to and learn from, in an organisation that I'm proud to be part of.

## Skills

#### Data handling and analysis

With no previous experience in databases, I joined St Luke's Hospice as the sole (and somewhat daunted) Database Administrator. Largely self-taught, I quickly became adept in using Blackbaud's SQL-based database Raiser's Edge. A year later I joined the database team at CARE International UK where I was often solely responsible for inputting, importing and running queries and reports on significant quantities of data. During my 6 years at CARE I continued to produce complex reports and analysis, building tools to optimise this data management and teaching my colleagues how to use them. I was also responsible for processing large numbers of transactions through Paypal.

#### Excellent communicator

I love using my verbal and written communication skills to connect with people. From delivering presentations about microfinance in the developing world to Rotary Clubs and university students, to teaching English to reluctant children in Spain and over-enthusiastic adults in Japan, I am well-experienced in explaining complex concepts to non-expert audiences. At both CARE International and St. Luke's Hospice I was responsible for composing and sending digital and written communications to the charities' supporters, including updates of the work, thank you messages, and fundraising asks. In summer 2019 I spearheaded an appeal that exceeded its fundraising target by 100%, raising over £100,000.

#### Account management

At CARE International I used my interpersonal skills to provide excellent client-facing service. This involved managing corporate Lendwithcare accounts, including adding and distributing funds on corporate partners' behalf, providing them with reports on their support, and answering any public enquiries. As part of the small team working on the innovative Lendwithcare.org platform, I worked closely with the developers, so thanks to my experience and empathy I can well understand user stories from the perspective of both the client and the developer!

#### Project management

As Senior Lendwithcare Executive I used my interpersonal and leadership skills to set up and remotely managed a national network of nearly 50 volunteers, facilitating them to promote and explain the charity's work in their local communities. This led to an increase in supporters for the charity, and increased engagement among the volunteers. In November 2018 I led a film crew to Zambia to direct a fundraising video to promote the charity's work (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HeWSX-K-Uk). As Donor Development Officer at St. Luke's Hospice I created a donation webpage that enabled supporters to set up a regular direct debit donation online.

#### Motivated self-starter

I have lived and worked abroad twice, teaching English at a secondary school in Granada, Spain in 2010-2011, and working as a private English teacher in Fukuoka, Japan in 2012-2013, despite having no contacts or networks in either country before moving there.
