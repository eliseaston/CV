## Elise Aston

Linguist turned junior full-stack software engineer (proof that I can talk to both humans and computers). Recent graduate from one of the most discerning coding bootcamps, with 6 years' experience of data, marketing, and digital communication in the charity sector. I'm looking to join a team I can contribute to and learn from, in an organisation that I'm proud to be part of.

## Skills

#### Data handling and analysis

With no previous experience in databases, I joined St Luke's Hospice as the sole (and somewhat daunted) Database Administrator, and quickly became adept (often self-taught) in using Blackbaud's SQL-based database Raiser's Edge. A year later I joined the database team at CARE International UK where, due to a long period of understaffing, I was often solely responsible for inputting, importing and running queries and reports on significant quantities of data. Upon changing teams at CARE, I continued to produce complex reports and analysis, building tools to optimise this data management and teaching my colleagues how to use them. I was also responsible for processing large numbers of withdrawal transactions through Paypal.

#### Excellent communicator

I enjoy connecting with people through my wide range of verbal and written communication skills. From delivering presentations about microfinance in the developing world to Rotary Clubs and university students, to teaching English to reluctant children in Spain and over-enthusiastic adults in Japan, I am well-experienced in explaining complex concepts to non-expert audiences. In my roles at CARE International and St. Luke's Hospice, I was responsible for composing and sending digital and written communications to the charities' supporters updates of the work, thank you messages, and fundraising asks. In summer 2019 I spearheaded an appeal that exceeded its fundraising target by 100%, raising over £100,000.

#### Account management

At CARE International I was responsible for providing excellent client-facing service. This involved managing corporate Lendwithcare accounts, including adding and distributing funds on corporate partners' behalf, and providing them with reports on their support, and answering any public enquiries. As part of the small team working on the innovative Lendwithcare.org platform, I worked closely with the developers and so well understand the perspective of explaining the needs of a client! I am excited about seeing this working relationship from the other side, and translating a client's needs into deliverable programs.

#### Project management

In my role at Lendwithcare I set up and remotely managed a national network of nearly 50 volunteers, facilitating them to promote and explain the charity's work in their local communities. This led to an increase in supporters for the charity, and increased engagement among the volunteers. In November 2018 I led a film crew to Zambia to direct a fundraising video to promote the charity's work (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HeWSX-K-Uk). As Donor Development Officer at St. Luke's Hospice I created a donation webpage that enabled supporters to set up a regular direct debit donation online.

#### Motivated self-starter

I have lived and worked abroad twice, teaching English at a secondary school in Granada, Spain in 2010-2011, and working as a private English teacher in Fukuoka, Japan in 2012-2013, despite having no contacts or networks in either country before moving there.
